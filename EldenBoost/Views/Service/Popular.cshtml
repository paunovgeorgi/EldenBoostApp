    <p>Released in early 2022, Elden Ring is the latest masterpiece in FromSoftware's long history of challenging third-person Action RPGs. As the newest addition to the Soulsborne lineage—built upon the foundations laid by its predecessors Dark Souls, Demon's Souls, and Bloodborne—Elden Ring had immense expectations to meet. And meet them it did, exceeding all anticipation.</p>
    <p>Taking the gaming world by storm, Elden Ring quickly became one of the most critically acclaimed titles ever, with millions of copies sold even before launch, fueled by an unparalleled hype train. This success was recently bolstered by the release of its highly anticipated expansion, Shadow of the Erdtree.</p>
    <p>Elden Ring didn't just deliver scale—it redefined it. The game improved upon the mechanics that made FromSoftware’s previous titles iconic, introducing features like jumping, mount riding, and enhanced verticality in level design. It combined the deliberate pacing of Dark Souls with the fast, fluid combat of Bloodborne, all while retaining the soul-crushing challenge that defines the series.</p>
    <p>However, one thing remained unchanged: the unrelenting difficulty that makes Soulsborne games legendary. Elden Ring is brutally hard, with one infamous boss racking up over 329 million player deaths within the first few months of release. Paired with the overwhelming variety of builds and gameplay options, it can be a steep learning curve, especially for newcomers to the franchise.</p>
